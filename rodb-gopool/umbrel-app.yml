  We're a solo mining pool running open-source software with split-coinbase payouts and transparent operations. This is true solo mining: if your miner finds a block, you get the block reward. We don't split rewards among miners--the miner who finds it gets paid.

  Reality check - Solo mining is probabilistic. Small miners can go months or years without finding a block. We don't know when--or if--you'll find one.
