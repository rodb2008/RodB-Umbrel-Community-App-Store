      <strong>PRIVACY NOTICE:</strong> This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our cryptocurrency mining pool service. By using the Service, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") applies to the cryptocurrency mining pool service operated by m45core.com (the "Service," "Pool," "we," "us," or "our") and governs the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information obtained from users ("you," "your," or "User") who connect mining devices or software to the Pool. The Service functions solely as a message forwarding service within the Bitcoin network. All block rewards are distributed automatically by the Bitcoin network through coinbase transactions; we do not process, aggregate, hold, or transmit any cryptocurrency.</p>

    <p>This Policy is incorporated into and forms part of our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.</p>
