    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms," "Agreement," or "TOS") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "Miner," "you," or "your") and the operator(s) of this mining pool service (the "Pool," "Service," "we," "us," or "our"). By:</p>
    <ul>

Instead, we will post updates on our GitHub repository and in our Discord community, in addition to publishing updates on the Service website.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>

    <h2>4. Service Description and Pool Operations</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Mining Pool Service</h3>
    <p>The Service operates as a cryptocurrency mining pool for Bitcoin. The Pool functions solely as a message forwarding service within the Bitcoin network, relaying mining-related messages between miners and the Bitcoin network. We do not aggregate computational resources, process mining operations, or control mining outcomes. All block rewards and transaction fees are distributed automatically by the Bitcoin network itself through the coinbase transaction written into each mined block. We do not distribute, hold, custody, or transmit any cryptocurrency or fiat currency. Reward distribution is determined entirely by the Bitcoin protocol based on the coinbase transaction structure.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Pool Fees</h3>
    <p>The Pool may charge fees as described on the Service interface. We reserve the right to modify fee structures at any time. Continued use of the Service after fee changes constitutes acceptance of the new fee structure.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Block Rewards and Coinbase Distribution</h3>
    <p>All block rewards and transaction fees are distributed automatically by the Bitcoin network through the coinbase transaction in each successfully mined block. The Bitcoin protocol itself handles all reward distribution based on the wallet addresses written into the coinbase transaction. We do not hold, custody, transmit, process, or distribute any cryptocurrency or fiat currency. Our only control is determining which wallet addresses and percentages are written into the coinbase transaction, specifically limited to our pool fee percentage as described on the Service interface. We reserve the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify the pool fee percentage and fee structure;</li>
      <li>Exclude miners from participating in mining if fraud, abuse, or Terms violations are suspected;</li>
      <li>Refuse to include miners' shares in block templates if system errors, bugs, or invalid work is detected; and</li>
      <li>Implement verification procedures for miner participation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have no control over when blocks are discovered, the amount of block rewards, or how the Bitcoin network distributes rewards from the coinbase transaction beyond determining which wallet addresses are written into the coinbase. All reward distribution occurs automatically on the Bitcoin network; we never possess, control, or transmit the cryptocurrency. We are not responsible for losses resulting from incorrect wallet addresses, cryptocurrency protocol issues, blockchain network problems, or other factors beyond our control. Block rewards are final and irreversible once confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Minimum Thresholds and Inactivity</h3>
    <p>Mining contributions that do not meet minimum thresholds for inclusion in share calculations may not be compensated. We reserve the right to exclude inactive miners or miners with insufficient valid shares from participating in mining operations as specified on the Service interface or as required by operational necessity. We have no ability to recover or redistribute rewards once they have been sent via blockchain transactions.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violating any applicable laws, regulations, or third-party rights;</li>
      <li>Using the Service to mine cryptocurrency without proper authorization or legal right;</li>
      <li>Submitting invalid shares, falsified work, or attempting to manipulate share accounting;</li>
      <li>Engaging in any form of fraud, abuse, or exploitation of the Service;</li>
      <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other users' accounts, or any systems or networks;</li>
      <li>Introducing viruses, malware, or any malicious code;</li>
      <li>Conducting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks or otherwise disrupting the Service;</li>
      <li>Reverse engineering, decompiling, or attempting to extract source code from the Service;</li>
      <li>Using automated scripts, bots, or tools to interfere with Service operations;</li>
      <li>Impersonating any person or entity or misrepresenting your affiliation;</li>
      <li>Collecting or harvesting information about other users without consent;</li>
      <li>Using the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Pool;</li>
      <li>Violating the security or integrity of any network, system, or account;</li>
      <li>Creating multiple accounts to circumvent restrictions or abuse the Service; or</li>
      <li>Assisting or encouraging any third party in any of the above activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Termination and Suspension</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Termination by Pool</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion and without prior notice or liability, to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Service;</li>
      <li>Refuse, cancel, or reject any shares or work submitted;</li>
      <li>Exclude miners from participating in mining operations;</li>
      <li>Ban IP addresses, wallet addresses, or worker IDs;</li>
      <li>Remove or disable any content or data; and</li>
      <li>Take any other action we deem necessary or appropriate,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>for any reason including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violation of these Terms or any applicable policies;</li>
      <li>Suspected fraud, abuse, or illegal activity;</li>
      <li>Service maintenance, upgrades, or discontinuation;</li>
      <li>Technical issues or security concerns;</li>
      <li>Legal or regulatory requirements; or</li>
      <li>Any other operational or business reason.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 Termination by User</h3>
    <p>You may terminate your use of the Service at any time by simply disconnecting your mining devices and ceasing to use the Service. Termination does not relieve you of any obligations incurred prior to termination.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
    <p>Upon termination of your access:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your right to use the Service immediately ceases;</li>
      <li>We may delete your account data and any associated information;</li>
      <li>Any mining contributions below minimum thresholds may not be included in future mining operations;</li>
      <li>We have no ability to recover or redistribute any rewards already sent via blockchain transactions;</li>
      <li>Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution provisions.</li>
    </ul>
